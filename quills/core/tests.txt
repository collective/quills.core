Let's explore and test quills.core.interfaces...

(N.B. These tests are written assuming that the implementation being tested
provides IWorkflowedWeblogEntry.)

The test-case class should have made self.weblog available to us.  We'll check
that (and save a few keystrokes in this file) and make sure it implements the
correct interface.

  >>> weblog = self.weblog
  >>> from quills.core.interfaces import IWeblog
  >>> IWeblog.providedBy(weblog)
  True

There shouldn't be any published entries in this weblog yet.

  >>> weblog.getEntries()
  []

There aren't any drafts either.

  >>> weblog.getDrafts()
  []

Now we'll add a weblog entry.

  >>> entry1 = weblog.addEntry(title='The First Title',
  ...                          excerpt='A little excerpting',
  ...                          text='foo bar baz',
  ...                          topics=['aTopic', 'bTopic'])

Of course, the new entry should implement the required interface.

  >>> from quills.core.interfaces import IWorkflowedWeblogEntry
  >>> IWorkflowedWeblogEntry.providedBy(entry1)
  True

The weblog now has a draft entry, but no published entries.

  >>> len(weblog.getDrafts())
  1
  >>> len(weblog.getEntries())
  0

We can check its workflow state and manipulate it.

  >>> entry1.isPublished()
  False
  >>> entry1.publish()

Publishing the entry should make it show up in the weblog.

  >>> len(weblog.getDrafts())
  0
  >>> len(weblog.getEntries())
  1

We can retract as well.

  >>> entry1.retract()
  >>> len(weblog.getDrafts())
  1
  >>> len(weblog.getEntries())
  0

When we created the entry, we gave it a title, an excerpt, some text, and some
topics.

  >>> entry1.getTitle()
  'The First Title'
  >>> entry1.getExcerpt()
  'A little excerpting'
  >>> entry1.getText()
  'foo bar baz'
  >>> entry1_topics = entry1.getTopics()
  >>> from quills.core.interfaces import ITopic
  >>> for topic in entry1_topics:
  ...   ITopic.providedBy(topic)
  True
  True

ITopic makes no requirement as to the order in which topics are returned.

  >>> entry1_topics = [topic.getId() for topic in entry1_topics]
  >>> entry1_topics.sort()
  >>> entry1_topics
  ['aTopic', 'bTopic']

The weblog should also be aware of these topics.

  >>> weblog_topics = weblog.getTopics()
  >>> for topic in weblog_topics:
  ...   ITopic.providedBy(topic)
  True
  True
  >>> weblog_topics = [topic.getId() for topic in weblog_topics]
  >>> weblog_topics.sort()
  >>> weblog_topics == entry1_topics
  True

We can get a topic by id from the weblog, and that topic will know about the
entries associated with it, but only when they are published.

  >>> aTopic = weblog.getTopicById('aTopic')
  >>> aTopic.getEntries()
  []
  >>> entry1.publish()
  >>> aTopic_entries = aTopic.getEntries()
  >>> len(aTopic_entries)
  1
  >>> aTopic_entries[0].getTitle() == entry1.getTitle()
  True
  >>> entry1.retract()

We get an empty topic if we ask for one that doesn't really 'exist' yet.

  >>> non_existant = weblog.getTopicById('wowowowow')
  >>> ITopic.providedBy(non_existant)
  True
  >>> non_existant.getEntries()
  []

There are also author topics, that act like topics for individual authors.

  >>> auth_topics = weblog.getAuthors()

After we've published our entry, there will only be one author topic.

  >>> len(auth_topics)
  0
  >>> entry1.publish()
  >>> auth_topics = weblog.getAuthors()
  >>> len(auth_topics)
  1

We can look-up entries on author topics just like we can with normal topics.

  >>> auth_topic = auth_topics[0]
  >>> len(auth_topic)
  1
  >>> auth_topic.getEntries()[0].getTitle() == entry1.getTitle()
  True
  >>> entry1.retract()

The weblog has an archive feature.

  >>> archives = weblog.getArchives()
  >>> from quills.core.interfaces import IWeblogArchiveContainer, IWeblogArchive
  >>> IWeblogArchiveContainer.providedBy(archives)
  True
  >>> IWeblogArchive.providedBy(archives)
  True

As the weblog entry isn't published, it won't show up in the archives.

  >>> archives.getEntries()
  []

So we'll publish it and then check again.

  >>> entry1.publish()
  >>> archive_entries = archives.getEntries()
  >>> len(archive_entries)
  1
  >>> archive_entries[0].getTitle() == entry1.getTitle()
  True

The archive is deeper than just the main archive container.  There are
sub-archives, too, and they should have access to the weblog entry as well.
Specifically, there are year archives...

  >>> year_subarchives = archives.getSubArchives()
  >>> len(year_subarchives)
  1
  >>> year_archive = year_subarchives[0]
  >>> len(year_archive)
  1
  >>> year_archive.getEntries()[0].getTitle() == entry1.getTitle()
  True

... and month archives...

  >>> month_subarchives = year_archive.getSubArchives()
  >>> len(month_subarchives)
  1
  >>> month_archive = month_subarchives[0]
  >>> len(month_archive)
  1
  >>> month_archive.getEntries()[0].getTitle() == entry1.getTitle()
  True

... and day archives...

  >>> day_subarchives = month_archive.getSubArchives()
  >>> len(day_subarchives)
  1
  >>> day_archive = day_subarchives[0]
  >>> len(day_archive)
  1
  >>> day_archive.getEntries()[0].getTitle() == entry1.getTitle()
  True
